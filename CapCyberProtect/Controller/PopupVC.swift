Some roads to the Nadi Airport are under water and currently impassable however water levels are expected to subside later today. All resorts and hotels are operating normally. The Fiji Meteorological Service advises that the depression is moving away slowly, but heavy rain is expected to continue over much of the country today and over the next 2-3 days."
